## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Jasmine is used to test against this pre-existing application to ensure it is functioning as intended.

## What I learned

Through the Udacity lessons and this project, I learned that testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application, including testing the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## Jasmine Documentation

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests. For additional information, please refer to the Jasmine website:
